![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/585c11d7-a88a-46dc-9db0-9b6688d6251c)

## Overview

This project is a robust interpreter for a custom programming language, leveraging the MVC design pattern and object-oriented principles. Key features include expression evaluation, file operations, heap management, garbage collection, and support for concurrency. The JavaFX GUI enhances user interaction.

## Features

1. **Core Components**:
    - **Statements**: Control structures, assignments, and more.
    - **Expressions**: Arithmetic, logical, and relational operations.
    - **Types/Values**: Integer, Boolean, String, Reference types.
    - **Data Structures**: Stack, Symbol Table, Heap, etc.

2. **Program State & Execution**: Tracks and manages program execution.

3. **Controller & Repository**: Manages state transitions and stores program states.

4. **View**: Console-based and GUI-driven program selection and execution.

5. **Advanced Capabilities**:
    - File operations and heap management.
    - Safe and unsafe garbage collection.
    - Concurrency handling.
    - Type checking before execution.

6. **Interactive GUI**: JavaFX interface with step-by-step or full program execution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
